OpenAI o3-mini-high single shot prompted asteroid game

Prompt:

Let's write a simple asteroid game using old school line based vector graphics.The spaceship should have similar controls and weapons as in the classic game.The 2d game view should be a topoological toroid as in the original game.The asteroids should have similar mechanics as in the original game.There is a collection of asteroids of three sizes, large, medium and small. The larger asteroids break down to the smaller category when a weapon shot hits them. If a shot hits a small asteroid it does not generate smaller asteroids but is destroyed in a small cloud of particles.Please implement the game as a single page html and javascript app that tries not to use any external libraries.
